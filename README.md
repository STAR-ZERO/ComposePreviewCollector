# Compose Preview Collector

This repository is a sample that collects and displays `@Preview` functions of Compose.

This sample uses [KSP](https://github.com/google/ksp) to collect `@Preview` functions.

## Usage

At first, write a `@Preview` code.

```kotlin
@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun PreviewGreeting() {
    // ...
}
```

And then, call the code generated code by KSP.

```
setContent {
    // Generated by ksp
    com.star_zero.compose.previewcolletctor.PreviewCollection()
}
```

Please see the code in this repository for more details.
